        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Kai's Dranzer is the only known dranzer with various improvements and is the Sacred Red Phoenix {Firebird Ghost} companion of Kai Hiwatari. he is the Spirit of Fire. He first appeared in Beyblade when Dragoon became Tyson's Bit-Beast and the Wind Spirit and Fire Spirit battled for the first time in the championships. Dranzer likes to get rid of her adversaries very fast. Dranzer's Japanese name is Suzaku. Dranzer was at one time deserted by Kai when he claimed Black Dranzer. Dranzer and Tyson, both feeling furious about being deserted, joined forces and Tyson launched Dranzer, who crushed Black Dranzer with the help of the three other Bit-Beast spirits. Dranzer will only materialize from his Bit-Chip when Kai calls fast to do him assault.</p>
